<h1>Licq</h1>
<p>We are currently moving Licq from our own Trac installation to GitHub so
this page doesn't contain much info just yet.</p>

<h2>Licq 1.5.0</h2>
<p>The latest Licq release is 1.5.0 and can be downloaded from
the <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

<h2>Get the source</h2>
<p>The source is available in our <a href="https://github.com/licq-im/licq">git
repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Get help</h2>
<p>If you have general questions post them to
the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/licq-users">licq-users</a> mailing
list. More development related questions and patches can be posted to
the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/licq-dev">licq-dev</a> mailing
list.</p>

<p>Many of the developers also hang on the IRC
channel <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/licq">#licq on
chat.freenode.net</a>. Drop by this IRC channel if you are interested in
helping out, want some help, or just wanna hang out with the people developing
your favourite instant messaging client.</p>
